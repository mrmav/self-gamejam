This game is part of a self hosted game jam with just two people. It is an excuse to force me to build something!

This game uses the little framework that I build in my spare time, as a learning exercise.

The todo list below has items for both the framework and game mixed in.

## mvp 1
- [x] Build animation system; 
- [x] Build input system; 
- [x] Add players; 
- [ ] Ice blocks you are fast; ()
- [ ] Snow blocks you are slow; ()
- [ ] Camera zooms out to ensure both players are in the game scene?; ()
    - If second player falls too behind, looses?

## mvp 2
- [ ] Build simple arcade physics engine; 
    - Maybe just overlap tests are needed.
- [ ] Each player has an health amount; 
- [ ] Obstacles deduct health; 

## mvp 3
- [ ] Multiple prebuilt tracks, selectable in the main menu; (mvp, only one track)
    - Requires building a tiled importer for the engine;
    - Also build custom object import;

## mvp 4
- [ ] Trails!;
- [ ] Each player has to collect its color flags to gain points?;
- [ ] Able to spawn snow flakes so the other player chrashes againts them (soft obstable);
    - For that you need to collect snowballs!
- [ ] Single player mode;

### Nice to have:
- [ ] Jumps!
- [ ] Transporter thinghy as an obstacle.
