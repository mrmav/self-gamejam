A about building a ski park!

Start with a rough terrain patch. This terrain will be a mountain cliff with rocks, jumps, trees and everything.

The player has to build a fun themed park. But theres a catch. When removing trees, monsters will start to spawn and kill the leisuring tourists!
To counter act this, the player must spawn snowmans, that will shoot snow balls agains the monsters.

A ski park building game with tower defense elements.

- Build simple arcade physics engine;
    - Maybe just overlap tests are needed.

- Multiple prebuilt tracks, selectable in the main menu;
    - Requires building a tiled importer for the engine;
    - Also build custom object import;
- Trails!;
- Camera zooms out to ensure both players are in the game scene?;
    - If second player falls too behind, looses?
- Ice blocks you are fast;
- Snow blocks you are slow;
- Each player has to collect its color flags to gain points;
- Each player has an health amount;
- Obstacles deduct health;
- Able to spawn snow flakes so the other player chrashes againts them (soft obstable);
- Single player mode;
