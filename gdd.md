A about building a ski park!

Start with a rough terrain patch. This terrain will be a mountain cliff with rocks, jumps, trees and everything.

The player has to build a fun themed park. But theres a catch. When removing trees, monsters will start to spawn and kill the leisuring tourists!
To counter act this, the player must spawn snowmans, that will shoot snow balls agains the monsters.

A ski park building game with tower defense elements.
